# Overview

Brook is a cross-platform microframework which helps to develop web Pascal applications built by [Delphi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)>) or [Lazarus IDE and Free Pascal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(IDE)>). Its core has been developed using the [Sagui library](https://risoflora.github.io/libsagui), that's why it is so fast, compact and useful to run on embedded systems.

# Features

- **Three threading modes:**
  - Event-driven - single-thread + polling.
  - Threaded - one thread per request.
  - Polling - pre-allocated threads.
  - Isolated request - request processed outside main thread.
- **Fast path routing that supports:**
  - Regular expression with [JIT](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2jit.html) optimization.
  - [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) for path entry-points.
- **HTTP compression:**
  - [Deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE) - for static strings and streaming.
  - [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip) - for file compression.
- **HTTP cookies:**
  - Providing classes which handles server side cookies.
- **HTTPS support:**
  - Data encryption through [GnuTLS](https://www.gnutls.org) library.
- **Dual stack:**
  - IPv4 and IPv6 on top of a single socket.
- **Basic authentication:**
  - For standard login using username and password.
- **Upload/download:**
  - Static body and payload.
  - Content streaming for real-time applications.
  - Small and large files transferring.
- **Mathematical expression evaluator:**
  - Arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators.
  - Variables allocation at build and/or run time.
  - Macro support to define functions at run time.
  - Extendable with custom functions.
  - Error handling with error kind and position.
- **Media types:**
  - Resolving media types ([MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)) in any supported platform.
- **String buffer:**
  - For fast operations involving strings.
- **String map:**
  - Hashed lists for key-value mapping.
- **And more:**
  - Discover more features by playing with our examples.

# Examples

The example below shows a minimal `hello world` HTTP server:

```delphi
type
  THTTPServer = class(TBrookHTTPServer)
  protected
    procedure DoRequest(ASender: TObject; ARequest: TBrookHTTPRequest;
      AResponse: TBrookHTTPResponse); override;
  end;

procedure THTTPServer.DoRequest(ASender: TObject; ARequest: TBrookHTTPRequest;
  AResponse: TBrookHTTPResponse);
begin
  AResponse.Send('Hello world', 'text/plain', 200);
end;

begin
  with THTTPServer.Create(nil) do
  try
    Port := 8080;
    if not Active then
      Exit;
    WriteLn('Server running at http://localhost:', Port);
    Open;
    ReadLn;
  finally
    Free;
  end;
end.
```
